# 📊 Cross Market Analysis  
### Data Science Portfolio Project (Python & SQL)

This project is part of my transition into **Data Science**, where I use **Python and SQL** to analyze cross-market data, identify patterns, and generate actionable insights.

The analysis is developed and executed in **Google Colab**, focusing on real-world problem solving and business-oriented data exploration.
